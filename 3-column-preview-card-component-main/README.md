## My process

Had fun making this challenge. I had some trouble with the columns' margins but I solved it using Flexbox, so I learned something new! :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is one of my first HTML/CSS projects and my first Frontend Mentor project.

I've got to practice with Flexbox and hover states, and this was the first time I used media queries to make a site responsive.

I hope you like it, and if you got some advice, I'd be glad to read it :).

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my abilities on Flexbox and CSS Grid, for they are currently one of the things I struggle more with.

I'm going to try and make more sites with JavaScript included, and I'd like to learn some Backend programming as well.
